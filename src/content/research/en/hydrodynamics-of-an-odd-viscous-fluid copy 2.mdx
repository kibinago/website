We theoretically study transport phenomena in an active chiral fluid with a particular interest in **odd viscosity**, which features **the breaking of the time-reversal and parity symmetries**. We have obtained the Green's function and the resistance tensor of disk-shaped objects in 2D odd flows. More recently, we have been interested in _active_ transport, such as dynamics of microswimmers, in _active_ fluids characterized by odd viscosity, by generalizing the versatile hydrodynamic principle called **the Lorentz reciprocal theorem** with odd viscosity.
