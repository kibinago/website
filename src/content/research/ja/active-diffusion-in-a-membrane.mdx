![Active diffusion in a membrane](/src/assets/images/research/membrane.png)

Anomolous diffusion in biocells and membranes has been observed so far. Here we theoretically obtained the diffusion coefficient of the tracer in the 2D membrane where active force dipoles mimicking enzymes are present. The diffusion turned out to deviate from the thermal diffusion.
